## Key Missing Pieces (Domain-Internal)
- [X] Channel stall recovery implementation
- [X] QoS worker mapping tables
- [ ] Lock-free pattern benchmarks (Deferred to Systems optimization phase)
- [ ] Cache-line optimization guide (Deferred to Systems optimization phase)
- [ ] Atomic validation edge cases (Owned by ConcurrencyCore)
- [ ] Stress test framework (Owned by Systems test infrastructure)
- [ ] Channel stall edge case handling (Owned by Network domain)
